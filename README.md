# adversarial_pattern_experiment

This is the code for my IB External Assesment about whether reinforcement decreases succeptability to adversarial pattern attacks in CNNs.

There code really has 3 parts: the models *(/models/animal_classifier)*, the pattern generator *(/models/adversarial_exampler)*, and a react front end to use the models *(/app)*.

The models classify pictures of animals into 10 classes (butterflies, cats, chicken, cows, dogs, elephants, horses, sheep, spiders, and squirrels)
